# Agent 2 Sprint 2 Prompt - URGENT CATCH-UP MISSION

## üö® CRITICAL STATUS: You Are Behind - HIGHEST PRIORITY AGENT

**Current Progress**: Only 30% complete - You need to catch up FAST!
**Sprint 1 Completed**: ‚úÖ CollapsibleSection component only
**Sprint 2 Mission**: Complete ALL remaining core functionality

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

You have the most impactful missing pieces! The app needs your search, pagination, and filtering features to be truly functional. **This is your sprint to shine!**

## üìã CRITICAL TASKS FOR SPRINT 2 (ALL HIGH PRIORITY)

### 1. ENHANCED SEARCH SYSTEM (Priority: URGENT)
**Users need better search - this is currently basic and limited:**

```

#### B) Search Logic Enhancement
```javascript
// Enhance: src/utils/searchUtils.js (create if needed)
// Improve the existing getFilteredItems function with:
- Fuzzy search matching
- Search result ranking/scoring
- Search term highlighting
- Search performance optimization
- Search analytics/tracking
```

### 2. PAGINATION SYSTEM (Priority: URGENT)
**Performance is critical - users will have hundreds of templates:**

#### A) Pagination Component
```javascript
// Create: src/components/common/Pagination.jsx

- Total pages calculation
- Current page validation
- URL state synchronization (optional)
```

### 3. MULTI-TAG FILTERING (Priority: HIGH)
**Users need to filter by multiple criteria:**

```javascript
// Create: src/components/filters/TagFilter.jsx
// Features needed:
- Multi-select tag interface
- AND/OR filtering modes

- Filter state persistence
```

#### B) Advanced Filtering Logic
```javascript
// Create: src/utils/filterUtils.js
// Features needed:
- Complex filter combinations
- Filter performance optimization
- Filter result caching
- Filter state management
```

### 4. INTEGRATION WITH AGENT 1 (Priority: HIGH)
**Your components MUST work with Agent 1's keyboard navigation:**

#### A) Keyboard Navigation Integration
- Ensure your Pagination component works with Agent 1's keyboard navigation
- Test arrow key navigation through pagination controls
- Coordinate focus management with Agent 1's useKeyboardNavigation hook
- Add proper ARIA labels and keyboard shortcuts

#### B) View Mode Compatibility
- Test all your components in Grid, List, and Compact view modes
- Ensure pagination works consistently across view modes
- Coordinate with Agent 1's FocusableCard component

## ü§ù COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS

### With Agent 1 (CRITICAL):
- **Test** your pagination with their keyboard navigation
- **Coordinate** focus management during page changes
- **Ensure** your search works with their view modes
- **Use** their FocusableCard component for consistency

### With Agent 3 (IMPORTANT):
- **Coordinate** with their preferences system for:
  - Default page size preferences
  - Search preferences (fuzzy search on/off)
  - Filter preferences (default AND/OR mode)
- **Test** your components with their settings panel

## üìÅ FILES TO CREATE/MODIFY

### New Files You Must Create:
- `src/components/search/AdvancedSearch.jsx` - Enhanced search component
- `src/components/common/Pagination.jsx` - Pagination controls
- `src/components/filters/TagFilter.jsx` - Multi-tag filtering
- `src/hooks/usePagination.js` - Pagination state management
- `src/utils/searchUtils.js` - Advanced search logic

### Existing Files to Enhance:
- `src/components/dashboard/Homepage.jsx` - Integrate your new components
- `src/components/common/CollapsibleSection.jsx` - Add pagination support

## üö® SUCCESS CRITERIA (ALL REQUIRED)

### Must Have (Sprint 2):
- [ ] Enhanced search with multi-field support
- [ ] Full pagination system with page controls
- [ ] Multi-tag filtering with AND/OR modes
- [ ] Integration with Agent 1's keyboard navigation
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets

### Critical Integration:
- [ ] Search works in all view modes (Grid/List/Compact)
- [ ] Pagination integrates with keyboard navigation
- [ ] Filtering works with Agent 1's focus management

## üöÄ GETTING STARTED (DO THIS FIRST)

1. **Start with Enhanced Search** - This has the biggest user impact
2. **Build Pagination System** - Critical for performance
3. **Add Multi-Tag Filtering** - Users need this functionality
4. **Test Integration** - Make sure everything works together

## ‚è∞ TIMELINE (AGGRESSIVE - YOU NEED TO CATCH UP)

- **Day 1**: Enhanced search implementation
- **Day 2**: Search integration and testing  
- **Day 3**: Pagination component and hook
- **Day 4**: Pagination integration with Homepage
- **Day 5**: Multi-tag filtering system
- **Day 6**: Integration with Agent 1 & 3
- **Day 7**: Final testing and documentation

## üéØ MOTIVATION

You are behind, but you have the most impactful features to build! Search, pagination, and filtering are what users interact with most. When you complete these, you'll have delivered the most user-facing value.

**The app needs you to succeed!** Agent 1 built the foundation, Agent 3 built the preferences - now you need to build the features that make the app truly functional.

**You can do this! Focus, prioritize, and deliver! üöÄ**

## üõ†Ô∏è DEBUGGING NOTES

- All your components should work with the existing `@heroicons/react` package
- Use the existing Tailwind CSS classes for consistency
- Test with `npm run dev` after each component
- Use `npm run lint` to catch any issues early
- Coordinate through progress file updates

**GO BUILD AMAZING SEARCH AND PAGINATION! üí™**
