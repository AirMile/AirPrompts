# Multi-Agent Coordination Plan: UI Improvements

## Overview
This project will be coordinated by **3 Claude Code agents** working in parallel on different phases of the UI improvement implementation. Each agent maintains their own progress file and coordinates with others through shared documentation.

## Agent Distribution

### Agent 1: Core Features (High Priority)
**Focus**: Phase 1 - Immediate impact features
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 weeks
**Coordination File**: `AGENT_1_PROGRESS.md`

### Agent 2: Organization Features (Medium Priority)  
**Focus**: Phase 2 - Enhanced organization and filtering
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 weeks
**Coordination File**: `AGENT_2_PROGRESS.md`

### Agent 3: Personalization Features (Low Priority)
**Focus**: Phase 3 - User preferences and dashboard widgets
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 weeks
**Coordination File**: `AGENT_3_PROGRESS.md`

## Agent 1: Core Features Implementation

### Responsibilities
- View mode system (Grid/List/Compact)
- Favorites section implementation
- Recently used items section

- **READ**: `AGENT_3_PROGRESS.md` for preferences system integration
- **WRITE**: `AGENT_2_PROGRESS.md` with progress updates and filtering APIs

### Dependencies
- Needs keyboard navigation support from Agent 1
- Must coordinate with Agent 3 on preference structure for section visibility
- Must ensure compatibility with Agent 1's view modes

---

## Agent 3: Personalization Features Implementation

### Responsibilities
- User preferences system and storage
- Layout customization options
- Dashboard widget system
- Category visibility controls
- Settings panel UI

### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/components/settings/UserPreferences.jsx`
- `src/hooks/useUserPreferences.js`
- `src/contexts/PreferencesContext.jsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/widgets/` (directory and components)
- `src/components/dashboard/DashboardLayout.jsx`

### Coordination Requirements
- **READ**: `AGENT_1_PROGRESS.md` for view mode state structure
- **READ**: `AGENT_2_PROGRESS.md` for filtering/section state structure
- **WRITE**: `AGENT_3_PROGRESS.md` with progress updates and preference schemas

### Dependencies
- Must integrate with Agent 1's view mode system
- Must support Agent 2's section visibility controls
- Lowest priority - can start after other agents establish core structure

---

## Coordination Protocol

### Daily Sync Process
1. Each agent **MUST** read other agents' progress files before starting work
2. Update own progress file with:
   - Completed tasks
   - Current blockers
   - Dependencies on other agents
   - API contracts and interfaces created
3. Commit progress files to shared repository daily

### Progress File Structure
Each agent maintains their file with these sections:
```markdown
# Agent [N] Progress - [Date]

## Completed Today
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

## In Progress
- [ ] Current task with estimated completion

## Blockers
- Dependency on Agent X for Y feature
- Technical issue with Z component

## API Contracts Created
- Hook/component interfaces for other agents

## Dependencies Needed
- What I need from other agents to proceed

## Next Steps
- Planned work for tomorrow
```

### Conflict Resolution
- **File conflicts**: Agent 1 has priority for Homepage.jsx base structure
- **Component conflicts**: Follow naming convention `[AgentN]_ComponentName.jsx` initially
- **Integration conflicts**: Create integration branch for merging work

---

## Shared Resources

### Common Files (Coordination Required)
- `src/components/dashboard/Homepage.jsx` - **Agent 1 leads, others coordinate**
- `src/components/PromptTemplateSystem.jsx` - **Agent 3 leads for state management**
- `src/types/template.types.js` - **All agents may need to extend**

### Testing Strategy
- **Agent 1**: Focus on keyboard navigation and accessibility testing
- **Agent 2**: Focus on filtering and pagination performance testing  
- **Agent 3**: Focus on preference persistence and widget testing

### Integration Points
1. **Week 1**: Agent 1 establishes base view mode structure
2. **Week 2**: Agent 2 integrates filtering with Agent 1's views
3. **Week 3**: Agent 3 integrates preferences with established systems
4. **Week 4**: All agents coordinate final integration and testing

## Communication Templates

### Dependency Request Template
```markdown
## Dependency Request from Agent [X] to Agent [Y]

**Feature Needed**: [Description]
**Required Interface**: [Code signature/API]
**Deadline**: [Date needed]
**Impact if Delayed**: [Consequences]
**Proposed Solution**: [Suggestion]
```

### Completion Notification Template
```markdown
## Completion Notification from Agent [X]

**Feature Completed**: [Description]
**Available Interface**: [Code/API details]
**Integration Instructions**: [How to use]
**Testing Status**: [Test results]
**Next Steps**: [What's next]
```

## Emergency Protocols

### If Agent Falls Behind
1. **Immediate**: Update progress file with realistic timeline
2. **Coordinate**: Notify other agents of impacts via progress files
3. **Escalate**: Request user intervention if blocking critical path
4. **Adjust**: Modify scope or redistribute tasks if needed

### If Conflicts Arise
1. **Document**: Record conflict in progress files
2. **Propose**: Suggest resolution in coordination files
3. **Implement**: Use established priority system (Agent 1 > Agent 2 > Agent 3)
4. **Verify**: Test resolution works for all parties

---

## Getting Started

### Initial Setup
1. Create the three coordination files:
   - `AGENT_1_PROGRESS.md`
   - `AGENT_2_PROGRESS.md` 
   - `AGENT_3_PROGRESS.md`

2. Each agent should:
   - Read this coordination plan
   - Read the original `UI_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`
   - Review current codebase structure
   - Create initial progress file with planned approach

### First Day Protocol
1. **Agent 1**: Start with keyboard navigation hook and view mode structure
2. **Agent 2**: Begin analyzing current filtering logic and planning enhancements
3. **Agent 3**: Research preference storage patterns and design preference schema

**Success depends on constant communication through progress files and adherence to the coordination protocol.**
