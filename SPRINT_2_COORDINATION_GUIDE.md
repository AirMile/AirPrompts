# Sprint 2 Coordination Guide - Multi-Agent Collaboration

## üéØ SPRINT 2 OBJECTIVES

**Mission**: Complete all missing functionality and achieve seamless integration between all agents' systems.

## üìä AGENT PRIORITY MATRIX

### üî¥ CRITICAL PRIORITY: Agent 2 (Organization Features)
**Status**: Only 30% complete - Most behind
**Impact**: Search, pagination, filtering are core app functionality
**Dependencies**: Agent 1 needs Agent 2's components for keyboard navigation

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY: Agent 3 (Personalization)
**Status**: 80% foundation complete - Needs integration & widgets
**Impact**: Preferences system unifies all features
**Dependencies**: Agent 1 & 2 need Agent 3's preferences for persistence

### üü¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY: Agent 1 (Core Features)
**Status**: Sprint 1 complete - Needs accessibility & integration
**Impact**: Foundation is solid, needs polish
**Dependencies**: Provides keyboard navigation for other agents

## ü§ù COORDINATION WORKFLOW

### Daily Coordination Protocol:
1. **Morning**: Each agent updates their progress file with current status
2. **Midday**: Check other agents' progress files before starting integration work
3. **Evening**: Update progress files with completed tasks and next steps

### Communication Files:
- `AGENT_1_PROGRESS.md` - Agent 1 daily updates
- `AGENT_2_PROGRESS.md` - Agent 2 daily updates  
- `AGENT_3_PROGRESS.md` - Agent 3 daily updates

## üîÑ INTEGRATION TIMELINE

### Days 1-2: Foundation Work
- **Agent 1**: Accessibility audit and ARIA implementation
- **Agent 2**: Enhanced search system implementation
- **Agent 3**: Fix linting issues and integration testing

### Days 3-4: Core Features
- **Agent 1**: Agent 2 integration testing
- **Agent 2**: Pagination system implementation
- **Agent 3**: Widget system foundation

### Days 5-6: Deep Integration
- **Agent 1**: Agent 3 integration and advanced features
- **Agent 2**: Multi-tag filtering system
- **Agent 3**: Deep integration with Agent 1 & 2

### Day 7: Final Integration
- **All Agents**: Final testing and coordination
- **All Agents**: Performance optimization
- **All Agents**: Documentation updates

## üéØ CRITICAL INTEGRATION POINTS

### Agent 1 ‚Üî Agent 2 Integration:
**What**: Keyboard navigation with search/pagination components
**When**: Days 3-4
**How**: Agent 2 tests their components with Agent 1's keyboard navigation
**Success**: Arrow keys work in pagination, search results are keyboard navigable

### Agent 1 ‚Üî Agent 3 Integration:
**What**: View modes with preferences system
**When**: Days 5-6
**How**: Agent 3 replaces Agent 1's localStorage with preferences
**Success**: View mode changes persist through preferences system

### Agent 2 ‚Üî Agent 3 Integration:
**What**: Search/pagination preferences
**When**: Days 5-6
**How**: Agent 3 adds Agent 2's settings to preferences panel
**Success**: Search and pagination preferences persist and work correctly

## üö® POTENTIAL CONFLICTS & SOLUTIONS

### Conflict 1: localStorage vs Preferences
**Issue**: Agent 1 uses localStorage, Agent 3 has preferences system
**Solution**: Agent 3 should migrate Agent 1's localStorage to preferences
**Priority**: High - affects user experience

### Conflict 2: Keyboard Navigation Integration
**Issue**: Agent 2's components need Agent 1's keyboard navigation
**Solution**: Agent 2 should test early and often with Agent 1's hooks
**Priority**: Critical - affects accessibility

### Conflict 3: Component Styling Consistency
**Issue**: Each agent may use different styling approaches
**Solution**: Follow existing Tailwind classes and component patterns
**Priority**: Medium - affects visual consistency

## üöÄ GETTING STARTED

1. **Read your individual Sprint 2 prompt** - Focus on your specific tasks
2. **Check other agents' progress daily** - Stay coordinated
3. **Test integration early and often** - Don't wait until the end
4. **Update progress files regularly** - Communication is key

## üìû ESCALATION PROCESS

If you encounter blocking issues:
1. **Document the issue** in your progress file
2. **Identify which agent** you need coordination with
3. **Propose a solution** or ask for specific help
4. **Continue with non-blocking tasks** while waiting for resolution

## üéâ MOTIVATION

Sprint 1 laid the foundation - now it's time to build the complete, integrated system! Each agent brings critical functionality:

- **Agent 1**: Accessibility and user experience excellence
- **Agent 2**: Core functionality that users interact with daily
- **Agent 3**: Personalization that makes the app truly user-friendly

**Together, you're building something amazing! üöÄ**
