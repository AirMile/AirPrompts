### Day 13-14: Integration Planning
- [ ] Coordinate with Agent 1 for view mode preferences
- [ ] Coordinate with Agent 2 for filtering preferences
- [ ] Plan final integration strategy

## Dependencies on Other Agents
### From Agent 1 (Core Features)
- **Need**: View mode state structure and keyboard navigation
- **Impact**: Preferences must integrate with view mode system
- **Timeline**: Week 2-3 coordination needed

### From Agent 2 (Organization Features)
- **Need**: Filtering state structure and section visibility
- **Impact**: Preferences must store filtering and organization settings
- **Timeline**: Week 2-3 coordination needed

## API Contracts Created
### Preferences Context (✅ COMPLETED)
```javascript
// Context interface for other agents to use
const PreferencesContext = {
  preferences: {
    layout: { viewMode, cardSize, density, columnsPerRow },
    sections: { workflows, templates, snippets },
    dashboard: { showFavorites, showRecent, recentCount, favoriteCount },
    filtering: { defaultPageSize, useInfiniteScroll, rememberFilters },
    accessibility: { highContrast, reducedMotion, keyboardNavigation }
  },
  updatePreferences: (updates) => void,
  updateSection: (section, updates) => void,
  resetToDefaults: () => void,
  exportSettings: () => string,
  importSettings: (data) => boolean,
  getPreference: (path, fallback) => any,
  setPreference: (path, value) => void
};
```

### useUserPreferences Hook (✅ COMPLETED)
```javascript
// Hook interface for accessing preferences
const useUserPreferences = () => {
  return {
    // State
    layout, sections, dashboard, filtering, accessibility,
    
    // Update methods
    updateLayout, updateSections, updateDashboard, updateFiltering,
    
    // Helpers
    setViewMode, setCardSize, setDensity,
    getGridColumns, getCardSpacing, getCardPadding,
    toggleSectionVisibility, toggleSectionCollapsed,
    
    // Accessibility
    shouldReduceMotion, shouldUseHighContrast, isKeyboardNavigationEnabled
  };
};
```

### Settings Components (✅ COMPLETED)
```javascript
// Settings panel with full preference management
const UserPreferences = ({ isOpen, onClose }) => {
  // Provides comprehensive UI for all preference categories
  // Includes import/export functionality
  // Real-time validation and error handling
};
```

## Current Understanding of Existing Code
### LocalStorage Usage
- Homepage.jsx uses localStorage for itemOrders and sectionVisibility
- Pattern: `localStorage.getItem/setItem` with JSON serialization
- Need to extend this pattern for comprehensive preferences

### State Management
- React state in PromptTemplateSystem component
- No existing context or global state management
- Good opportunity to add preferences context

## Waiting for Dependencies
### Agent 1 Dependencies
- **View Mode Structure**: Need to know how view modes are implemented
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Need to ensure settings are keyboard accessible
- **Status**: Monitoring AGENT_1_PROGRESS.md

### Agent 2 Dependencies
- **Filtering State**: Need to understand filtering state structure
- **Section Visibility**: Need to coordinate with collapsible categories
- **Status**: Monitoring AGENT_2_PROGRESS.md

## Current Blockers
- **Integration**: Ready to coordinate with Agent 1's view mode system and Agent 2's collapsible sections
- **Next Phase**: Need to integrate preferences with existing view mode localStorage in Homepage.jsx:35-49

## Today's Achievements
1. **✅ Foundation Complete**: Built comprehensive preference system with storage, context, and hooks
2. **✅ Settings UI**: Created full-featured settings panel with import/export
3. **✅ API Contracts**: Provided clear interfaces for other agents to integrate with
4. **✅ Coordination**: Monitored other agents' progress and identified integration points
5. **✅ Code Quality**: Fixed linting issues and followed existing patterns

## Integration Points Identified
- **Agent 1**: Homepage.jsx:35-49 has viewMode localStorage - needs preference integration
- **Agent 2**: CollapsibleSection component needs section visibility preferences
- **Both**: Keyboard navigation preferences ready for accessibility settings

## Next Steps
1. Start with preference system architecture - can work independently
2. Monitor other agents' progress files daily
3. Begin settings panel UI design
4. Coordinate integration timing with other agents

## Notes
- Priority: Preferences system is foundation for all personalization
- Focus on creating flexible, extensible preference structure
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing localStorage patterns
- Lowest priority agent - can wait for others to establish foundations
