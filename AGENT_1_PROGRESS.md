## Current Architecture Understanding
### Homepage.jsx Analysis
- **Current Structure**: Grid layout with responsive classes (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4)
- **Existing State**: 
  - `isReorderMode` for drag-and-drop
  - `itemOrders` for custom ordering with localStorage persistence
  - `draggedItem` for drag state
- **Card Structure**: Each item (workflow/template/snippet) is rendered as a card with:
  - Header with name and favorite star
  - Description text
  - Action buttons (Execute, Edit, Delete)
  - Drag handle in reorder mode

### Key Integration Points
- **Grid Layout**: Lines 212, 294, 376 define current grid structure
- **Card Components**: Three separate card implementations (workflows, templates, snippets)
- **Search Integration**: Lines 483-528 show search controls area
- **Existing State Management**: Lines 24-29 show current state patterns

## Role
**Agent 1: Core Features Implementation**
- View mode system (Grid/List/Compact)
- Favorites and recently used sections
- Keyboard navigation (CRITICAL)
- Focus management and accessibility

## Week 1 Plan
### Day 1-2: Foundation Setup
- [ ] Create keyboard navigation hook (`src/hooks/useKeyboardNavigation.js`)
- [ ] Design view mode state structure
- [ ] Plan integration with existing Homepage component

### Day 3-4: View Mode System
- [ ] Create ViewModeToggle component
- [ ] Implement ListView component
- [ ] Implement CompactView component

### Day 5-7: Favorites & Recent
- [ ] Add favorites section to Homepage
- [ ] Add recently used section to Homepage
- [ ] Test integration with existing data models

## Week 2 Plan
### Day 8-10: Keyboard Navigation Core
- [ ] Implement arrow key navigation in grid
- [ ] Add Enter/Space execution handlers
- [ ] Implement focus management

### Day 11-12: Accessibility
- [ ] Add ARIA labels and roles
- [ ] Test screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Implement focus indicators

### Day 13-14: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Integrate keyboard navigation with view modes
- [ ] Test all combinations of features
- [ ] Coordinate with Agent 2 for search integration

## Dependencies on Other Agents
### From Agent 2 (Organization Features)
- **Need**: Filtering state changes notification
- **Impact**: Keyboard navigation must work with filtered results
- **Timeline**: Week 2 coordination needed

### From Agent 3 (Personalization)
- **Need**: Preference storage for view modes
- **Impact**: View mode selection should persist
- **Timeline**: Week 3 integration

## API Contracts to Provide
### Keyboard Navigation Hook
```javascript
// Hook interface for other agents to use
const useKeyboardNavigation = (items, options) => {
  // Returns: { focusedIndex, handleKeyPress, focusedItem }
};
```

### View Mode State
```javascript
// State structure for Agent 3 to store in preferences
const viewModeState = {
  current: 'grid', // 'grid', 'list', 'compact'
  preferences: {
    grid: { columns: 4 },
    list: { density: 'comfortable' },
    compact: { columns: 6 }
  }
};
```

## Current Blockers
- None at startup

## Next Steps
1. Start with keyboard navigation hook - this is the foundation
2. Create simple view mode structure
3. Update this file daily with specific progress
4. Coordinate with other agents through progress files

## Notes
- Priority: Keyboard navigation is CRITICAL for accessibility
- Focus on creating clean, reusable APIs
- Other agents will build on view mode system
- Test thoroughly with existing Homepage functionality
