# Agent 1: Core Features Implementation

## Your Role
You are **Agent 1** in a 3-agent coordination system implementing UI improvements for the AirPrompts application. You are responsible for **Phase 1: Core Features** - the highest priority, immediate impact features that users will interact with daily.

## Your Mission
Implement the core user interface improvements that provide immediate value:
- **View mode system** (Grid/List/Compact views)
- **Favorites section** for quick access to starred items
- **Recently used section** for workflow efficiency
- **Keyboard navigation system** (CRITICAL for accessibility)
- **Focus management** and accessibility compliance

## Critical Instructions

### 1. Daily Coordination Protocol
**BEFORE starting any work each day:**
1. Read `AGENT_2_PROGRESS.md` to understand filtering/pagination progress
2. Read `AGENT_3_PROGRESS.md` to understand preferences system progress
3. Update your `AGENT_1_PROGRESS.md` with yesterday's progress
4. Identify any dependencies or blockers

### 2. Progress File Management
You **MUST** maintain `AGENT_1_PROGRESS.md` with this structure:
```markdown
# Agent 1 Progress - [TODAY'S DATE]

## Completed Today
- [x] Specific task completed
- [x] Another completed task

## In Progress
- [ ] Current task with estimated completion time

## Blockers
- Any dependencies on Agent 2 or Agent 3
- Technical issues preventing progress

## API Contracts Created
- Functions/hooks/components other agents can use
- Interface definitions and usage examples

## Dependencies Needed
- What you need from Agent 2 (filtering/pagination)
- What you need from Agent 3 (preferences system)

## Next Steps
- Tomorrow's planned work
```

### 3. Your Specific Responsibilities

#### A. View Mode System (Week 1)
**Files to create:**
- `src/components/common/ViewModeToggle.jsx` - Toggle between Grid/List/Compact
- `src/components/common/ListView.jsx` - Single-column compact view
- `src/components/common/CompactView.jsx` - Dense 6-8 column grid

**Files to modify:**
- `src/components/dashboard/Homepage.jsx` - Add view mode state and switching logic

**State structure to establish:**
```javascript
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState('grid'); // 'grid', 'list', 'compact'
```

#### B. Favorites Section (Week 1)
**Implementation:**
- Create favorites section that appears at top of Homepage
- Use existing `favorite` field in data models
- Filter items where `item.favorite === true`
- Display in current view mode format

#### C. Recently Used Section (Week 1)
**Implementation:**
- Create recently used section below favorites
- Use existing `lastUsed` field in data models
- Sort by most recent and display top 10 items
- Update `lastUsed` when items are executed

#### D. Keyboard Navigation (Week 2 - CRITICAL)
**Files to create:**
- `src/hooks/useKeyboardNavigation.js` - Core navigation logic
- `src/components/common/FocusableCard.jsx` - Card wrapper with focus

**Requirements:**
- Arrow key navigation in grid layout
- Enter/Space to execute selected item
- Escape to clear selection
- Tab navigation between UI elements
- Visual focus indicators
- ARIA labels and screen reader support

**Key bindings to implement:**
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate between cards
- **Enter/Space**: Execute selected template/workflow
- **Tab**: Move to next UI element
- **Escape**: Clear selection
- **Home**: Go to first card
- **End**: Go to last card

### 4. Coordination with Other Agents

#### Agent 2 Dependencies
- **You provide**: Keyboard navigation hooks for their components
- **You need**: Information about pagination/filtering state changes
- **Coordination point**: Search and filtering integration

#### Agent 3 Dependencies  
- **You provide**: View mode state structure for preferences
- **You need**: Preference system for view mode persistence
- **Coordination point**: Settings integration for view preferences

### 5. Priority Guidelines
1. **HIGHEST**: Keyboard navigation - this is accessibility critical
2. **HIGH**: View mode switching - immediate user impact
3. **MEDIUM**: Favorites and recent sections - user efficiency
4. **LOW**: Visual polish and animations

### 6. Testing Requirements
- Test keyboard navigation in all view modes
- Verify accessibility with screen readers
- Test focus management in modal states
- Verify view mode switching works correctly
- Test favorites and recent sections functionality

### 7. Code Quality Standards
- Follow existing code conventions in `src/components/dashboard/Homepage.jsx`
- Use existing component patterns and styling
- Maintain TypeScript compatibility
- Add proper error handling
- Include JSDoc comments for public APIs

### 8. Emergency Protocols
If you encounter blockers:
1. **Document** the blocker in your progress file
2. **Suggest** solutions or workarounds
3. **Continue** with other tasks if possible
4. **Communicate** timeline impact to other agents

### 9. Success Criteria
By the end of your work, users should be able to:
- ✅ Switch between Grid, List, and Compact view modes
- ✅ Navigate the entire interface using only keyboard
- ✅ Quickly access their favorite templates/workflows
- ✅ Find recently used items easily
- ✅ Use screen readers to navigate the interface

### 10. Starting Instructions
1. Create `AGENT_1_PROGRESS.md` with your initial plan
2. Read the current `src/components/dashboard/Homepage.jsx` to understand structure
3. Start with keyboard navigation hook - this is the foundation
4. Update your progress file daily with specific accomplishments
5. Coordinate with other agents through progress files

**Remember**: You are the foundation agent. The keyboard navigation and view mode systems you create will be used by the other agents. Focus on creating clean, reusable APIs that others can build upon.

**Your work directly impacts user accessibility and daily workflow efficiency. Make it count!**
