# Agent 1 Sprint 2 Prompt - Accessibility & Integration Master

## üéØ SPRINT 2 MISSION: Accessibility Excellence & Cross-Agent Integration

**Status**: Sprint 1 COMPLETED ‚úÖ - You are the most successful agent so far!
**Priority**: HIGH - Your keyboard navigation is the foundation other agents depend on

## üìã CRITICAL TASKS FOR SPRINT 2

### 1. ACCESSIBILITY AUDIT & IMPLEMENTATION (Priority: URGENT)
**Your keyboard navigation is amazing, but needs accessibility polish:**

#### A) ARIA Labels & Screen Reader Support
- Add comprehensive ARIA labels to all interactive elements in your components
- Implement proper `role` attributes for custom UI elements
- Add `aria-describedby` for complex interactions
- Test with screen readers (if possible) or add proper semantic HTML

#### B) Focus Management Enhancement
- Ensure focus indicators are visible and high-contrast
- Add proper focus trapping in modal-like interactions
- Implement skip links for keyboard users
- Add `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates

#### C) Keyboard Navigation Polish
- Add Escape key support to exit navigation modes
- Implement Home/End keys for jumping to first/last items
- Add Page Up/Page Down for bulk navigation
- Ensure Tab order is logical and predictable

### 2. CROSS-AGENT INTEGRATION (Priority: HIGH)
**Other agents are waiting for your keyboard navigation to work with their components:**

#### A) Agent 2 Integration (CollapsibleSection)
- Ensure your keyboard navigation works with Agent 2's CollapsibleSection component
- Test arrow key navigation within collapsed/expanded sections
- Coordinate focus management when sections expand/collapse
- Test with Agent 2's upcoming pagination system

#### B) Agent 3 Integration (Settings Panel)
- Make sure your keyboard navigation works with Agent 3's UserPreferences component
- Ensure view mode changes via settings are properly handled
- Test keyboard navigation in different view modes triggered by preferences
- Coordinate with Agent 3's preference system for navigation settings

### 3. ADVANCED KEYBOARD FEATURES (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Build on your solid foundation:**

#### A) Smart Focus Restoration
- Remember last focused item when returning to view
- Restore focus after executing templates/workflows
- Handle focus restoration after view mode changes

#### B) Navigation Enhancements
- Add type-ahead/search functionality with keyboard
- Implement vim-style navigation (h/j/k/l) as alternative
- Add Ctrl+shortcuts for common actions

### 4. INTEGRATION TESTING & COORDINATION (Priority: HIGH)
**Ensure everything works together:**

#### A) Test All View Modes
- Verify keyboard navigation in Grid, List, and Compact views
- Test favorites and recently used sections
- Ensure consistent behavior across all view modes

#### B) Performance Optimization
- Optimize keyboard navigation for large datasets
- Test with 100+ items to ensure smooth performance
- Implement virtual scrolling support if needed

## ü§ù COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS

### With Agent 2:
- **Test** your keyboard navigation with their CollapsibleSection
- **Coordinate** focus management during section expand/collapse
- **Prepare** for their upcoming pagination system integration

### With Agent 3:
- **Test** your keyboard navigation with their settings panel
- **Coordinate** preference-driven navigation settings
- **Ensure** view mode changes preserve keyboard navigation state

## üìÅ FILES TO FOCUS ON

### Your Existing Components (Polish these):
- `src/hooks/useKeyboardNavigation.js` - Add accessibility features
- `src/components/common/FocusableCard.jsx` - Enhance ARIA support
- `src/components/common/ViewModeToggle.jsx` - Add keyboard support
- `src/components/dashboard/Homepage.jsx` - Test integration points

### Integration Points:
- `src/components/common/CollapsibleSection.jsx` (Agent 2's component)
- `src/components/settings/UserPreferences.jsx` (Agent 3's component)
- `src/contexts/PreferencesContext.jsx` (Agent 3's context)
