2. **Read other agents' progress files** to understand blockers
3. **Identify coordination needs** for the day
4. **Plan integration testing** if components are ready

### Midday Check-in:
1. **Update progress on current tasks**
2. **Flag any blockers** that need other agents' help
3. **Coordinate integration testing** if components are ready

### Evening Wrap-up:
1. **Complete task status updates**
2. **Prepare coordination needs for tomorrow**
3. **Test integration points** if components are ready
