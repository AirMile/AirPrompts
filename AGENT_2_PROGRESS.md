### In Progress
- [ ] Keyboard navigation integration testing with Agent 1 - **HIGH**
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets - **MEDIUM**
- [ ] Final integration testing with all agents - **HIGH**

## Role
**Agent 2: Organization Features Implementation**
- Collapsible categories with state persistence
- Pagination system for better performance
- Enhanced search and multi-tag filtering
- Custom collections/folders extension
- Infinite scroll alternative to pagination

## Week 1 Plan
### Day 1-2: Collapsible Categories Foundation
- [x] Analyzed current filtering logic in Homepage.jsx:64-94
- [ ] Create CollapsibleSection component with smooth animations
- [ ] Implement useSectionVisibility hook with localStorage persistence
- [ ] Integrate with existing Homepage sections (workflows, templates, snippets)

### Day 3-4: Enhanced Search Integration
- [ ] Analyze current search implementation in Homepage
- [ ] Extend getFilteredItems function for multi-tag filtering
- [ ] Prepare search state structure for Agent 3 preferences

### Day 5-7: Pagination System
- [ ] Create Pagination component with configurable page sizes
- [ ] Implement usePagination hook for state management
- [ ] Add performance optimizations for large datasets

## Week 2 Plan
### Day 8-10: Pagination System
- [ ] Create Pagination component
- [ ] Implement usePagination hook
- [ ] Add configurable page sizes

### Day 11-12: Tag Filtering
- [ ] Create TagFilter component
- [ ] Implement multi-tag filtering logic
- [ ] Add AND/OR filtering modes

### Day 13-14: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Integrate pagination with Agent 1's view modes
- [ ] Test filtering with keyboard navigation
- [ ] Coordinate with Agent 3 for preferences

## Dependencies on Other Agents
### From Agent 1 (Core Features)
- **Need**: Keyboard navigation hooks for collapsible sections
- **Impact**: All new components must support keyboard navigation
- **Timeline**: Week 2 coordination needed
- **Status**: Agent 1 working on keyboard navigation hook structure

### From Agent 3 (Personalization)
- **Need**: Preferences system for pagination/filtering settings
- **Impact**: Page size and filter preferences should persist
- **Timeline**: Week 3 integration
- **Status**: Agent 3 designing preference structure

## API Contracts to Provide
### Section Visibility Hook
```javascript
// Hook interface for other agents to use
const useSectionVisibility = (sectionId, defaultVisible = true) => {
  // Returns: { isVisible, toggle, setVisible }
};
```

### Filtering State Structure
```javascript
// State structure for Agent 3 to store in preferences
const filteringState = {
  pageSize: 12,
  currentPage: 1,
  tags: [],
  searchQuery: '',
  showFavorites: false,
  sortBy: 'name',
  sortOrder: 'asc'
};
```

## Current Understanding of Existing Code
### Filtering Logic (Homepage.jsx:64-94)
- Current implementation handles folder filtering and basic search
- Uses `getSearchFields` function to search across multiple fields
- Folder filtering has complex logic for different folder types
- Search is case-insensitive and searches across all fields

### Existing State Management
- Uses React state in PromptTemplateSystem component
- localStorage used for itemOrders and sectionVisibility patterns
- No pagination currently implemented

### Integration Points
- Must work with existing folder filtering logic
- Should extend current search functionality
- Need to maintain compatibility with existing itemOrders state

## Current Blockers
- **Minor**: Waiting for Agent 1's keyboard navigation hook interface
- **Strategy**: Will implement collapsible categories first, then integrate keyboard navigation

## Next Steps
1. Start with CollapsibleSection component - provides immediate value
2. Implement useSectionVisibility hook with localStorage persistence
3. Integrate with existing Homepage sections
4. Monitor Agent 1 progress for keyboard navigation integration
5. Prepare filtering state structure for Agent 3 preferences

## Notes
- Priority: Collapsible categories will provide immediate organization improvement
- Focus on extending existing patterns rather than replacing them
- Must maintain compatibility with existing folder system
- Performance is crucial for large template/workflow libraries
